## Database & Data Safety Checklist
<!-- If this PR touches database schemas, migrations, or data models, complete this section; otherwise check No Database Changes and mark the rest N/A. -->
- [ ] **No Database Changes**: This PR does not touch schemas, tables, or queries.
- [ ] **Expand-Contract Pattern** (when live/compatibility-sensitive data): All schema alterations are additive (non-breaking for rolling deploys); one-shot/disposable/pre-deployment may skip with documented rationale; otherwise `N/A`.
- [ ] **No Destructive Drops**: No unauthorized `DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, or `TRUNCATE` operations in this phase (when EC applies).
- [ ] **Row-Level Security (RLS)** (when multi-tenant data exists): Policies verified for tenant/organization boundary enforcement; otherwise `N/A`.
- [ ] **Query Efficiency** (when DB queries exist): Composite indexes added for high-cardinality filters and sorted queries; otherwise `N/A`.

## Rollback Strategy
<!-- How can this deployment be safely reversed if an incident occurs in production? -->

## Pre-Submission Quality Gate
- [ ] Static checks pass with 0 errors (`tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript, or project's equivalent — `cargo check` / `ruff check` / `go vet` / `flutter analyze`)
- [ ] All automated test suites pass locally per the project's verification
- [ ] Scanned for secret leaks (`.env`, credentials, private tokens)
- [ ] Verified all temporary debug probes (`[DEBUG-xxxx]`) are removed
- [ ] Conforms to project guidelines in `PROMPTKIT.md` (and `DESIGN.md` if applicable)
