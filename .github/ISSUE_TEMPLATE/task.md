## User Story & Context
<!-- Describe who benefits, what capability is unlocked, and why now. -->
**As a** `[user role or persona]`  
**I want** `[action or capability]`  
**So that** `[measurable business or technical value]`

## Technical Scope & Invariants

### Files & Endpoints Touched
- **Database Tables / Migrations**: `[path/to/schema.ts or migrations/]`
- **Services / Handlers**: `[path/to/service.ts]`
- **API Endpoints**: `[METHOD /api/v1/path]`
- **UI Components**: `[path/to/component.tsx]`

### Non-Negotiable Invariants (mark applicable items; use `N/A - <reason>` where not applicable)
- [ ] **Data Isolation** (when multi-tenant or persistent data exists): Tenant Row-Level Security (RLS) or organization ID enforced on every query; otherwise `N/A - <reason>`.
- [ ] **Schema Safety** (when schema or migration exists): Expand-Contract pattern followed for live or compatibility-sensitive data — one-shot, disposable, or pre-deployment changes may skip with documented rationale; otherwise `N/A - <reason>` and zero instantaneous destructive drops when EC applies.
- [ ] **Security & Validation** (when external input exists): Runtime schema validation using the project's native mechanism (e.g. Zod/Valibot for TypeScript) applied to all external input; otherwise `N/A - <reason>`.
- [ ] **Budget & Performance** (when API or data path exists): No N+1 query loops; API response p95 within target SLA; otherwise `N/A - <reason>`.

### Out of Scope
<!-- Explicitly list what this issue will NOT address to prevent scope creep. -->
- `[Feature or boundary excluded from this specific issue]`

---

## Implementation Tasks (The Build)
<!-- Concrete, ordered sequence of files and functions to create or modify. -->
- [ ] 1. Define schema types and database migration (`Expand` phase) where persistent storage exists; otherwise `N/A - <reason>`.
- [ ] 2. Implement domain service logic and state validation.
- [ ] 3. Expose API endpoint with structured error envelope (or interface-appropriate contract).
- [ ] 4. Wire client query hook and presentation component (or interface-appropriate surface).
- [ ] 5. Write automated unit and integration tests.

## Acceptance Criteria (The Verifiable Proof)
<!-- Concrete conditions of satisfaction. All must pass before this issue can be closed. -->

### Scenario 1: Happy Path
- **Given** `[precondition or system state]`
- **When** `[action taken or event triggered]`
- **Then** `[expected outcome or response status]`

### Scenario 2: Negative & Error Edge Cases
- **Given** `[unauthenticated user or invalid payload]`
- **When** `[request is dispatched]`
- **Then** `[expected error (e.g. for HTTP APIs: 400, 401, 403, 409, 429) or interface-appropriate error and structured message]`

### Scenario 3: Boundary & Concurrency (If Applicable)
- **Given** `[duplicate concurrent requests with same idempotency key]`
- **When** `[processed simultaneously]`
- **Then** `[only one transaction succeeds without data corruption]`
