- **Active RFC / Spec**: `docs/specs/2026-09-20-m1-local-task-gate.md` (approved 2026-09-20; §9 addendum records toolchain decisions)
- **Active Task Spec**: `docs/tasks/2026-09-20-m1-local-task-gate.md` plus `docs/tasks/2026-09-20-m1-task-breakdown.md` and linked Scope Change 1
- **Key Source Files in Flight**: `src/cli.ts`, `src/verifyTask.ts`, `tests/verify.test.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`; T7 canonical status reconciliation is also uncommitted.

## 3B. Release-Evaluation Handoff (Optional)

> Use this projection only when PromptKit OS release evaluation is being handed from QA/Reviewer to a Release Coordinator. It is a durable handoff, not approval, and the canonical evaluation or Task Record remains authoritative.

- **Evaluation ID**: `[evaluation ID or N/A]`
- **Release Candidate Commit**: `[exact candidate revision or N/A]`
- **Preliminary SemVer Candidate**: `[preliminary version, including prerelease identifier when applicable, or N/A]`
- **QA/Reviewer Result**: `[Pass | Fail | Pending | N/A]`
- **Unresolved Blockers**: `[blocker, owner, and resolution condition, or None]`
- **Requested Release Coordinator Decision / Next Approval Action**: `[exact human decision requested, or N/A]`
- **Handoff Status**: `[Ready for Coordinator Review | Blocked | Deferred | N/A]`
- **Approval Boundary**: `This projection does not approve a candidate or version and does not authorize tag creation, hosted release creation, changelog publication, remote operations, deployment, or rollback.`
- **Source Evaluation / Task Record**: `[authoritative record path or N/A]`

## 4. Locked Technical Invariants (Do Not Undo)
- Sureflow invariants (carried from ARCHITECTURE.md §§7/41 + user brief, preserved as design intent, not implemented code): control plane owns authority; minimum sufficient context; risk/context independent; workflows = intent, policies = authority; capabilities = actions; skills = knowledge, never authority; workers disposable, state durable; multi-agent optional + cost-gated; evidence > model confidence; verification stays deterministic; explicit human approval for protected ops; MCP optional external provider; Git/tasks/evidence/events/state distinct; CLI = intent, router = topology; token efficiency never overrides correctness; CPAC > raw token minimization; every subsystem justifies complexity.
- Discovery constraint: no stack invented — CONTRIBUTING.md forbids assuming runtime/PM/CI before adoption (observed 2026-09-20).
- Human M-D1..M-D5 (2026-09-20, `docs/adrs/2026-09-20-stack-and-m1-boundary.md`): TS+Node stack; local tracking for M1; 5 protected ops + max-1-retry-then-HALT; `.sureflow/state/` authoritative, `docs/STATE.md` never runtime state; isolated `fixtures/t0-basic/`, never own source tree as fixture.
- Human M-D6..M-D13 (2026-09-21, `docs/adrs/2026-09-21-m1-t6-preflight-contracts.md`): terminal `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`; T8 before T6; closed `npm-test` dispatch; no OS-sandbox claim; fixed process-result mapping; only initial started-process nonzero exit retries; verification follows terminal retry resolution; fixture expectation remains independent.

## 4A. Candidate Learnings (Unpromoted)

Staging area for rules observed during sessions but not yet approved as invariants. Entries here are **never pre-filled** and are non-authoritative: agents must not treat them as policy, quote them as invariants, or copy them into project guardrails. Promotion requires a recorded human decision (`approved` / `rejected` / `deferred`) with approver, date, evidence reference, and destination (see `protocols/context-sync.md` §3.1).

| Date | Proposed Rule | Source / Evidence | Scope | Status | Human Decision (approver, date, destination) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026-09-20 (M0 discovery) | ~15 | host telemetry unavailable | ~150k tok total (~8k-15k tok/turn heuristic) | Discovery reads of 8 docs + Task Record + spec + STATE.md sync; heuristic per checkpoint protocol, not billing telemetry |
| 2026-09-20 (M1 spec) | ~14 | host telemetry unavailable | ~140k tok total (~8k-15k tok/turn heuristic) | ADR + M1 spec + M1 Task Record + STATE/PROMPTKIT sync; heuristic, not billing telemetry | not tracked |

## 5. Known Blockers, Risks & Open Questions
- **Blockers**:
  - T6 integration acceptance and T7 verification are complete. T9–T11 remain gated / not started.
- **Architectural Questions**:
  - Remaining from M0: C1 router/topology contract; C4 evidence schema key finalization + UNKNOWN transition table; C6 cost-gate units (deferred post-M1); C7 capability-filter before MCP (deferred post-M1); C8 stack-agnostic verify-adapter interface (M1 avoids via fixture-local verify). C2/C3/C5 closed by M-D4/M-D3. Full text: `docs/specs/2026-09-20-sureflow-discovery-intake.md` §5.
- **Technical Debt & Risks**:
  - R1 stack-by-default — CLOSED by explicit human M-D1 (+ ADR). R2 full-core-at-once — mitigated by binding M1 non-goals. R3/R4/R5 standing. npm emitted an `ignore-workspace-root-check` user-config deprecation warning during all three verification commands; it did not fail a gate.

## 6. Recent Architectural Decisions (ADR Log)
| Date | Title & Scope | Decision Summary | ADR File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026-09-20 | M1 stack/tracking/protection/state/fixture (M-D1..M-D5) | TS+Node; local tracking; 5 protected ops + 1 retry then HALT; `.sureflow/state/` authoritative; `fixtures/t0-basic/` | `docs/adrs/2026-09-20-stack-and-m1-boundary.md` |
| 2026-09-21 | M1 T6 preflight contracts (M-D6..M-D13) | terminal `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`; T8 before T6; closed profile; no OS-sandbox claim; fixed result mapping and retry/verification order | `docs/adrs/2026-09-21-m1-t6-preflight-contracts.md` |

## 7. Next Immediate Actions (Queued)
